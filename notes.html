      <h1> The World Wide Web</h1>

      <p>
            <b>HMTL</b> stand for HyperText Markup Language and is how browsers
            read web pages. <br>
            In addition to your browser and computer, there is the internet
            and also servers.  <br> All of this web communication happens through <b>HTTP</b>-HyperText Transfer
            Protocol.

            I learned <b>several</b> HTML <a href="https://www.udacity.com">
            elements</a> in this <em>lesson</em>.
            Most HTML elements have opening and closing tags, except for void
            tags, which don't require closing tags.
            I also learned how to make <a href="https://www.reddit.com">links</a>
            to websites and link pictures
            <img src "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-kittens-7-57b30aa10707a__605.jpg" alt="Cute Kitten"><br>
            Thankfully, text will be displayed, if the picture fails to load.<br>
            The second-to-last thing I learned was the difference between inline and block elements.
            Block elements form an invisible box around text, like the p tags wrapping this text.
            The br tag I used four times above, is an inline tag.
            <p><em>Block elements:</em> p, div, form</p>
            <strong>Inline elements:</strong> a, span, br, image, strong<br><br>
            The last thing i learned was document structure.  I hope this
            document in structured correctly. You must declare your doctype,
            and wrap your document in opening and closing html tags.<br>
            It is also important to have a title for the browser and reader.

      <p> It helps to think of HTML as organized in a tree format.
        Within each tag, there may be more tags, like an image or text.
        The styling is done by CSS, and everything is put in boxes.
        It is easy to think of a webpage as a number of boxes. Often,
        there are boxes inside boxes.  </p>
